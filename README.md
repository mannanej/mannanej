I really like to code in Java, and figure out different forms of computer automation using PowerShell/CMD/AutoHotkey! If there is a repetitive computer based task, I'm all about
finding a way to make the computer do it for me, and twice as fast.

My current languages include:
- Java
- Python
- C++
- Arduino
- MatLab
- Maple
- PowerShell
- CMD
- Small amount of Linux commands
- Small amount of JavaScript
- Small amount of HTML
